If you have installed PC Speed Cat on your computer, you might have noticed that it claims to be a system optimizer that can fix various issues and improve your PC speed. However, you might also have realized that it is a potentially unwanted program (PUP) that tries to trick you into buying its full version before it can do anything useful. In fact, PC Speed Cat can do more harm than good to your computer, as it can create fake registry errors, display annoying pop-ups, and even expose you to malware infections. In this article, we will show you how to remove PC Speed Cat from your computer and how to boost your PC performance without using any dubious software.
 
## What is PC Speed Cat?
 
PC Speed Cat is a PUP that is advertised as a system optimizer. It is developed by SpeedCat LLC and is bundled with other free software that you download from the Internet. When you install such software, you might not notice that PC Speed Cat is also included as an optional offer. Once installed, PC Speed Cat will scan your computer and report that it has found several issues that need to be fixed. However, if you try to fix them, PC Speed Cat will ask you to buy its full version for $39.95. This is a scam, as the issues that PC Speed Cat detects are either exaggerated or nonexistent. Moreover, PC Speed Cat can slow down your computer, display annoying pop-ups, change your browser settings, and even compromise your security by exposing you to malware infections.
