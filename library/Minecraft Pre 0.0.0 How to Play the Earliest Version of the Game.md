# How to Download Minecraft Pre 0.0.0, the Earliest Version of the Game
 
Minecraft is one of the most popular and influential video games of all time, but did you know that it started as a simple "Cave Game" back in 2009? The earliest version of Minecraft, known as Pre 0.0.0, was a prototype that featured only cobblestone and grass blocks, and basic physics. If you are curious about how Minecraft looked and played like in its infancy, you can download and try it out for yourself. Here's how:
 
**Download Zip â€” [https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fblltly.com%2F2uGUNs&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1HSpRe9kHQeqKhAiSNu-Tu](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fblltly.com%2F2uGUNs&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1HSpRe9kHQeqKhAiSNu-Tu)**


 
1. Download the Minecraft Java Edition launcher from [Minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download). You will need a legal copy of the game to access the launcher.
2. Install the game using the setup file provided, and open the launcher. It may need to update after opening.
3. Enter the settings tab in the launcher. Tick the box next to the option that says "Show historical versions of Minecraft: Java Edition in launcher."
4. Tab over to the "Installations" header. Select "New Installation."
5. Here, you can select which build of Minecraft you would like to play. To play Pre 0.0.0, scroll down to the bottom of the list and choose "rd-132211 (May 13th, 2009)". You can also name the installation, set a file directory, and select a resolution.
6. Once the installation has been created, select "Play" for the installation, and it will begin Minecraft in Pre 0.0.0. There may also be a warning regarding player experience concerns, but this can be accepted.
7. Enjoy! Be aware that this version is very primitive and may contain bugs, errors, or other quality of life issues. Since this version was used during testing phases before Minecraft's full release, players should exercise caution.

Minecraft Pre 0.0.0 is a fascinating glimpse into the origins of the game that would later become a cultural phenomenon. In this version, you can explore a randomly generated world made of cobblestone and grass blocks, and interact with the basic physics of the game. You can place and break blocks with the mouse, and move around with the arrow keys. There is no inventory, crafting, survival, or multiplayer in this version. It is simply a sandbox for creative expression and experimentation.
 
Some of the features and quirks of Pre 0.0.0 include:

- The world is infinite in size, but it may take a while to load new chunks.
- The world is flat and has no biomes, caves, structures, or water.
- The blocks have no textures or colors, only shades of gray.
- The blocks have no sounds or particles when placed or broken.
- The blocks have no gravity or collision detection, so they can float in mid-air or overlap with each other.
- The blocks can be placed on any surface, even on the sides or bottoms of other blocks.
- The blocks can be broken instantly with any mouse button, regardless of distance or angle.
- The game has no menu, options, or pause button. To exit the game, you have to press Alt+F4 or close the window.

Playing Minecraft Pre 0.0.0 can be a fun and nostalgic experience for fans of the game who want to see how it all began. It can also be a challenge for creative builders who want to make something impressive with limited resources and tools. If you are interested in trying out other early versions of Minecraft, you can follow the same steps as above and choose different builds from the launcher. You can also watch videos or read articles about the history and evolution of Minecraft online.
